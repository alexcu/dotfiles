# dotfiles

Config and installs for homebrew, zsh, oh-my-zsh, and git and emacs (among others).

Begin by:

1. Cloning into `~/.dotfiles`.
1. Installing within each of the directories:
    1. run `./install.command`, or
    1. open `./install.command` in Finder.

Anything in `archive` is pretty old.
